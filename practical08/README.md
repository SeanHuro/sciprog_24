# Practical 8

This cointains the code for practical 8. The code in file GDC.c takes two positive integers as inputs and returns the Greatest Common Denominator of the two integers. It does this using both an iterative and recursive approach.

## Compilation

To compile the file, use the following code:

```bash
gcc GDC.c -o GDC
```

## Run Code

To run the file, the following command is used:

```bash
./GDC
```

## Result

For an input of 20 and 6, the output is:

IterativeGDC(20, 6) = 2

RecursiveGDC(20, 6) = 2
