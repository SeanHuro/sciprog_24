# Practical 9

The code files here can be used to tell if an nxn matrix is a magic square. A magic square is an nxn matrix where the row sums, column sums and diagonal sums are equal to the same number.

## Compilation
To run this code, the following command is used:

```BASH
gcc main_stub.c -o out
```

## Result

When ran, the user is asked to input a filename.

Result when 'magic_square.txt' is inputted:

This is a magic square

Result when 'not_magic_square.txt' is inputted:

This is not a magic square
