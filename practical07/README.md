# Practical 7

This contains the code files for practical 7.

The file e.c is used to estimate the value of e using factorials.

The file pointers.c creates a 1x5 vector of ones and prints it out.

## Compiling

To compile this code, use the following command:

```bash
gcc e.c -o matrix -lm

gcc pointers.c -o pointers
```

## Execution

To execute this code:
```bash
./e

./pointers
```

The output of e.c is as follows:

Inputted Value: 10

e is estimated as 2.7182818011, with difference -2.731266e-08

The output of pointers.c is as follows:

1 1 1 1 1
